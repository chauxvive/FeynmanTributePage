        <h3 class="text-center">A Timeline of Feynman's Life and Work:</h3>
          <ul class="list-style">
            <li><b>1918</b> Feynman is born in Queens, NYC</li>
            <li><b>1921</b> Feynman says his first word</li>
            <li><b>1933</b> Feynman teaches himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and integral and differential calculus. Like you do</li>
            <li><b>1936</b> Feynman is turned down from Columbia because they've already fufilled their Jewish quota for the year. He goes to MIT instead</li>
            <li><b>1936-1939</b> Feynman switches from majoring in mathematics to electrical engineering to physics</li>
            <li><b>1939</b> Feynman aces the Princeton entrance exam in physics but does poorly on history and English. Again, he was almost not let in because he was Jewish (although a professed atheist)</li>
            <li><b>1939</b> Feynman has a seminar with Einstein. The rules of his scholarship dictate he may not be married to his sweetheart, who is dying of tuberculosis</li>
            <li><b>1941</b> Feynman is recruited to <em>the Manhattan Project</em></li>
            <li><b>1942</b> Having received his doctorate, Feynman marries Arlene Greenbaum in the city office with no friends or family present. He brings her to the hospital, where her prognosis is poor and he may only visit on weekends</li>
            <li><b>1943</b> A bored Feynman takes up lock-picking as a hobby, breaking into top secret areas for fun</li>
            <li><b>1944</b> Fellow physicist Klaus Fuchs speculates Feynman may be a spook which ensures the FBI get a full file on Feynman. It is later revealed to be Fuchs that was the spook</li>
            <li><b>1945</b> Feynman's wife Arlene dies. The first atom bomb is tested</li>
            <li><b>1949</b> Feynman returns from Rio with a Brazilian girl and a new passion for bongo drums. He is still of high interest to the FBI</li>
            <li><b>1952</b> Feynman marries Mary Bell. They divorce in 1958</li>
            <li><b>1953</b> Feynman starts teaching at Caltech</li>
            <li><b>1960</b> Feynman creates a now famous curriculum overhaul which survives as <em>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</em>. His knack for breaking complex ideas into simple pieces and comparisons makes his work still some of the most accessible high level physics work today </li>
            <li><b>1960s</b> Feynman begins granting interviews that become <em>Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!</em></li>
            <li><b>1988</b> Feynman dies after a ten year battle with cancer. He said he "had told so many stories to so many people, even when he died he wouldn't be really gone." His legacy proves this is still true today</li>
          </ul>
      <p class="text-center pb-3"> His last words were "I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring." </p>
