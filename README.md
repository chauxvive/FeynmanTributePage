# Richard Feynman Tribute Page

>“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.” 
>― Richard P. Feynman

### This is my Feynman Tribute Page from Free Code Camp's Responsive Design Certificate 

### This is a simple one-page project using the Chicago Tribune stylesheet for a clean, newspaper-like look.
